android-kata-sieve
==================

An implementation of the [Sieve of Eratosthenes] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) under android.

This project is serving multiple purposes:

- Help me pick up some of the Java language
- Help me pick up junit
- Let me touch a mobile platform
- Provide me an opportunity to test Emacs for Java development
 
The core of the program is the seive class, and is mostly in plain Java.  At this time, the test suite is built
using Android testing harnesses (which is why I say /mostly/ in plain Java).

My background being Perl, I am used to testing using TAP.  I am learning how testing under Java works, as well
as Java itself (it has been 15+ years since I have done anything of consequence with Java).
